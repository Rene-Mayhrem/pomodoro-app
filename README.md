# pomodoro-app

## Project Idea

I want to create a task managment tool similar to trello and notion. But I want to add another features to my app. 
- I want to add new functions such the creation of tasks, where the user can add multiple properties that he can define with a name and the action-
- The property has a name and also an action or better said a value: checkbox, date, text, number, select, status, multi-select, and another property that can be added is a pomodoro timer.
- Another tool that I want to add is for a trackpad for daily habits or activities, such as reading and be able to assign how many times you want this to repeate, and assign pomodoro blocks.
- I want the visualization of the app to two views. One for habits and another for tasks. This two can be filtered in day, week, or monthly. 
- Want to create a checkbox to keep track of how many days someone is willing to fullfill the commitment such as github commit and that kind of things.

Do you have an idea? Or more recommendations to add to my app?
