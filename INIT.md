## Project Idea

I want to create a task management tool similar to Trello and Notion. But I want to add additional features to my app.
- I want to add new functions such as the creation of tasks, where the user can add multiple properties that they can define with a name and the action.
- The property has a name and also an action or better said a value: checkbox, date, text, number, select, status, multi-select, and another property that can be added is a pomodoro timer.
- Another tool that I want to add is for a trackpad for daily habits or activities, such as reading and being able to assign how many times you want this to repeat, and assign pomodoro blocks.
- I want the visualization of the app to have two views. One for habits and another for tasks. These two can be filtered by day, week, or month.
- I want to create a checkbox to keep track of how many days someone is willing to fulfill the commitment such as GitHub commits and that kind of thing.
